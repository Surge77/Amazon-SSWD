## Steps for creating a module in js to avoid naming conflict

## Testing  

testing in JavaScript is about writing code that checks your code. You feed your functions certain inputs, then assert that the output matches what you expect.

- Manual Testing => Manual testing means a human (like you) is clicking around, running your app, and checking if things work as expected.

- Automated Testing => Automated testing means you write code that automatically tests your code.

#### Generally we should have two types of test cases

1. Basic Test Cases
2. Edge Cases

### Testing Framework
