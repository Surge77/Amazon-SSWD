### üß© Webhook Verification Failing (Stripe Integration)

**Context:**  
While integrating Stripe for subscription payments, the webhook responses were inconsistent during local development.

**Challenge:**  
Stripe was sending webhook events, but my backend wasn't verifying the signatures correctly, causing silent failures. Localhost exposure added complexity.

**Insight:**  
Realized that the webhook secret was changing with each ngrok tunnel, and I wasn‚Äôt handling raw request bodies correctly.

**Solution:**  
Used Stripe CLI to create a persistent tunnel. Switched to `express.raw` middleware before body parsing to ensure signature integrity. Also externalized the secret to `.env` for easier environment handling.

### üß© MongoDB Timeout During Rapid API Testing

**Context:**  
During load testing with Postman, MongoDB connections were timing out intermittently.

**Challenge:**  
The error wasn't consistent, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a code issue or infra bottleneck.

**Insight:**  
After logging connection attempts, I saw too many parallel connects due to no reuse in my DB layer.

**Solution:**  
Refactored the database utility to maintain a single connection instance using the Singleton pattern. Reduced cold start issues and stabilized the connection pool.

### üß© JWT Token Persistence Issue After Refresh

**Context:**  
Logged-in users were being logged out on page reload.

**Challenge:**  
Despite storing the token in localStorage, auth state was resetting.

**Insight:**  
The issue wasn‚Äôt token loss ‚Äî it was that my frontend wasn‚Äôt rehydrating the user context from storage on boot.

**Solution:**  
Implemented a `useEffect` on app mount that checks for token presence and fetches user data to restore session. Also added automatic token refresh with Axios interceptors.
